Gravity Forms Salsa Add-On
==========================================

Integrates [Gravity Forms][gravity] with [Salsa][salsa] allowing supporters
to be saved to Salsa and added to groups.

Usage
-----

Create your Gravity Form as usual and then add admin values for form elements
that you want saved to Salsa. These values should match the field names
in Salsa (i.e. First_Name).

Constraints
-----------

* Subfields are not supported. You need a single field per Salsa field so you can specify an admin value
